# Predicting Similarity to Closest Known Reactions as a Surrogate for Reactivity

This repository contains the code and resources for **Predicting Similarity to Closest Known Reactions as a Surrogate for Reactivity**. The project aims to efficiently evaluate reaction feasibility by leveraging similarity-based metrics and machine learning models.

## ðŸ“¦ 1. Requirements
Make sure you have the following packages installed:
## 1.1 Package
* python==3.9.18  
* numpy==1.26.2  
* pandas==2.1.1 
* scikit-learn==1.3.2  
* rdkit==2023.9.2
* scipy==1.11.4
* seaborn==0.13.1
* tqdm==4.66.1
* xgboost==2.0.3

We suggest that you can install these packages by pip.

## ðŸš€ 2. How to Use
### 2.1 Reaction generation
You can find reaction generation part in folder **(generate_model)**. We provided a well trained model **uspto_model_v1_epoch60.pth**, so you can use it dirctly. We also provided the training dataset **uspto_reaction_smile_aug.txt**, you can also train a new model.
* genarationv6_mult_step.ipynb: it generated new molecules.
* combine_result_v1.ipynb: it combined new molecules to new reaction based on the reaction template.

### 2.2 Correlation evaluation
The **Correlation Evaluation** folder contains a comprehensive evaluation of the relationship between various reaction similarity measures and reactivity scores. Specifically, we assess the correlation of four different reaction similarity metrics and two reactivity scores provided by ASKCOS mentioned in the paper with the reactivity of 180 manually labeled Suzuki reactions.

### Included Files:
- `correlation evaluation(ASKCOS_augmented_Transformer_score).ipynb`:  
   This notebook evaluates the correlation between the ASKCOS augmented transformer score and the reaction reactivity.
   
- `correlation evaluation(ASKCOS_fast_filter_score).ipynb`:  
   This notebook evaluates the ASKCOS fast filter score's correlation with reaction reactivity.
   
- `correlation evaluation(MACCS_Dice).ipynb`:  
   This notebook computes the correlation between the MACCS Dice similarity and reaction activity.
   
- `correlation evaluation(Transformercosine).ipynb`:  
   This notebook assesses the correlation of Transformer-based cosine similarity with reactivity.
   
- `correlation evaluation(ecfp_Dice).ipynb`:  
   This notebook evaluates the Dice similarity for ECFP fingerprints.
   
- `correlation evaluation(rxnpfp_cos).ipynb`:  
   This notebook measures the correlation using cosine similarity with RXNFP fingerprints.
  
- `ROC_AUC curve.ipynb`: 
#### Analysis Details:
   - Each similarity score is treated as a predictor for classifying reaction reactivity.
   - The **Area Under the ROC Curve (AUC)** is computed to quantify the classification performance, with higher AUC values indicating stronger predictive power.
   - This analysis serves as a measure to evaluate how well the similarity metrics can discriminate between reactive and non-reactive cases.

   

### 2.3 Similarity prediction
You can find the XGBoost model to predict similarity and the SHAP analysis part. We apply SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) to interpret the contribution of each feature in the similarity prediction process. This helps in understanding the model's decision-making and provides transparency in reaction feasibility prediction.
